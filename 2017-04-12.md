# Mysql, and utf8 encoding

Companies which have DBAs, its very common that tables get created with different
charset and collation. Of late, we have ran into that problem and exploring over
web resulted in this link

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/766809/whats-the-difference-between-utf8-general-ci-and-utf8-unicode-ci

This link advocates that we should always use `utf8mb4` format while creating
databases, tables and columns!

Rails has this support which is discussed here in this github issue:
https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9855

Encoding and collation can be specified like this:
https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.0.2/activerecord/test/config.example.yml#L57
