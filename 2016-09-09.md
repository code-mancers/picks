## Best Development Practices:
1. Never rename or edit the migration file which already has been merged into master instead create new migration to alter the table schema.

2. Don't use underscore in css class name, use hyphen instead. For example: `class-name` not `class_name`.

3. Always use html class to apply styling using css, never use element id to apply styling in css.

4. Prepend class-name or element id by js if it is being used to manipulate using Javascript.

  For example: Use `js-element-id` or `js-class-name`  
  Instead of: `element-id` or `class-name`

5. (Rails) Always use ActiveRecord transactions to bind database calls while running multiple database operation.
This will rollback all the changes to database if any one of the database query fails.
~~~ruby
ModelClass.transaction do
  User.create!(email: params[:email], username: params[:username])
  Profile.create!(email: params[:email], name: params[:name])
end  
~~~
In above mentioned case if `User` create query succeeds but `Profile` create fails then the user created by `User.create!(email: params[:email], username: params[:username])`
will be deleted. That's the beauty of using transactions that it rollbacks to the previous state if anything goes wrong.

If you don't use transactions but want to achieve the same functionality then the code will look like this

~~~ruby
user = User.create!(email: params[:email], username: params[:username])
profile = Profile.create!(email: params[:email], name: params[:name])

unless profile do
  user.destroy
end
~~~
